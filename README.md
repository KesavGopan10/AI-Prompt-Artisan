üöÄ Key Features

‚úçÔ∏è Multi-Modal Input: Go beyond text. Use your voice to speak your mind or sketch an idea on the canvas. The AI interprets your input in any form.

üåê Multi-Language Genius: Think and create in your native language (supports Hindi, Spanish, Japanese, and more). The app automatically translates and refines your ideas into professional English prompts.

üîÆ Expert Enhancement: Leverages the power of the Gemini API with advanced system instructions to apply prompt engineering best practices, crafting clear and effective prompts tailored for different use cases.

üí° Creative Spark: Stuck for an idea? Use the "Generate Idea" feature to get a random, creative prompt to kickstart your imagination.

üíæ Save & Reuse: Build your personal library of powerful prompts. Save your favorites with one click, categorized by type, and easily copy them for later use.

üîí Secure & Private: Your Gemini API key is encrypted with crypto-js and stored securely in your browser's local storage. It is never transmitted anywhere else.

ü§î How It Works

AI Prompt Artisan is a frontend application built with React and Vite that interacts directly with the Google Gemini API.

Input: You provide a creative idea through text, voice (using the Web Speech API), or a drawing.

Processing:

For Text/Voice: The text is sent directly to the Gemini API for enhancement.

For Drawing: The canvas sketch is converted to a JPEG, sent to the Gemini multi-modal endpoint to generate a text description, and that description is then used as the input for enhancement.

Enhancement: A carefully crafted system prompt instructs the Gemini model to act as a "world-class prompt engineering expert." It translates the input to English if necessary and then generates a JSON object containing three optimized prompt variations:

Generic: A clear, well-structured, general-purpose prompt.

Chatbot: A detailed prompt for conversational AIs (like ChatGPT or Gemini), often including role, context, and formatting instructions.

Image Generation: A descriptive, comma-separated prompt perfect for models like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion.

Output: The application parses the JSON response and displays the three enhanced prompts in a clean, user-friendly interface, ready for you to copy or save.

üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites

Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)

A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one for free at Google AI Studio.

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

Generated bash
git clone https://github.com/KesavGopan10/AI-Prompt-Artisan.git
cd AI-Prompt-Artisan


Install dependencies:

Generated bash
npm install
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Set up your API Key:
The application needs your Gemini API key to function. You have two options:

Option A (Recommended): Environment Variable
Create a file named .env.local in the root of the project and add your API key:

Generated code
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This key will be available during development.

Option B: In-App Settings
Run the app and click the settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the header. This will open a modal where you can paste and save your API key. The key will be securely encrypted and stored in your browser's local storage.

Run the development server:

Generated bash
npm run dev
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Open the URL provided in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) to view the app.

Available Scripts

npm run dev: Starts the development server with hot-reloading.

npm run build: Builds the app for production to the dist folder.

npm run preview: Serves the production build locally to preview it.
